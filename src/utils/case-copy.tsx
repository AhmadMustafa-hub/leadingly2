          <strong>Problems encountered by Brand Heroes </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Since Brand Heroes targeted several segments, the company encountered the undermentioned
          issues from multiple directions
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Small and medium-sized companies: </strong>While finding the right person at large
          corporations proved to be a challenge, the client also had problems crafting messages for
          small and medium-sized companies. It was necessary to find the right wording and highlight
          the benefits relevant to such businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Startups: </strong>Startups that have secured Series A funding were the
          clients&apos; main focus. The search was not turning up any prospects who would fit the
          ICP, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Event agencies: </strong>It was the most fruitful direction following COVID 19.
          Many businesses that relied on events to attract new clients required help making the
          transition from live to virtual events.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Businesses utilizing Drupal: </strong>Many companies will need to alter their
          content management system and move to another platform because Drupal 7 is nearing its
          demise. While some prospective customers were aware of it and began to investigate
          WordPress, other candidates had not yet grasped the significance of making modifications.
          It is the cause of this segment&apos;s complexity, which necessitated extensive
          investigation and the use of precise phrasing. It aided in demonstrating the client&apos;s
          knowledge and substantiating how it relates to the requirements of future clients.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>A. Initial strategy </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To increase sales, the client relied on face-to-face encounters. This approach allowed us
          to maintain our routine:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Targeting</strong>: We looked for organizations involved in the retail, fashion,
          apparel, and entertainment industries that had offices in New York, USA, and were willing
          to meet with the client&apos;s representatives in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Writing templates: </strong>To encourage prospects to plan a face-to-face {"("}F2F
          {")"}
          meeting with a Brand Heroes representative, we used a series of templates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Nurturing</strong>: In order to ensure that the prospects reached the narrow end
          of the sales funnel and could be transferred to the client&apos;s sales teams, our SDRs
          guided the prospects through each stage of the funnel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>B. Corona scenario </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          There has been a dramatic decrease in F2F meetings since the COVID 19 crisis began.
          Throughout December, our F2F campaign performance declined, with a greater number of
          negative answers than scheduled meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our situation, the problem was the imminent COVID 19 disaster. We had to adapt on the
          fly and revise our templates, methodologies, and sales development strategies for Brand
          Heroes when Covid-19 hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          For our staff, this was indeed a difficult situation. We conducted extensive analytics,
          participated in numerous brainstorming sessions, and launched numerous A|B testing
          campaigns in order to optimize each direction and extract the maximum productivity out of
          every campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1{")"} Small and medium-sized enterprises</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We took extra care to choose the best strategy in order to reach and engage as many target
          audience groups as we could. Before we could determine which campaign would be the most
          successful, our copywriter teams tested at least six different templates and cadences.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2{")"} Startups </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it was difficult to find firms that had just obtained Series A funding, we had to
          restrict our search to <strong>50 appointments per week</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3{")"} Event planners </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          During the pandemic, this advice came in really handy. Businesses from this section needed
          help adjusting to the new reality of social isolation and quarantine after presentations,
          conferences, meetings, conventions, and various other live activities had to be canceled.
          They required changing how they advertised their services, developing communication plans,
          and setting up fresh virtual events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brand Heroes&apos; services were therefore extremely pertinent to these potential
          customers. As a result, it didn&apos;t take long to put our research, template authoring,
          and phrasing into practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>4{")"} Our client&apos;s Ideal Customer Profile was expanded </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          It requires a great deal of precision and investigation to comprehend how other users of
          technology use it. We started by broadening the client&apos;s Ideal Customer Profile to
          generate accurate statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5{")"} Email drip campaigns </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We continued to warm up our prospects on LinkedIn in addition to all of our outreach and
          research initiatives to spark their interest in the client&apos;s product and forge
          connections. These efforts focused on engaging the LinkedIn community and subtly asking
          potential customers about their business continuity strategy.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          We started and modified the approach for Brand Heroes throughout the course of nine
          months. Within this time span, we had to address the difficulties brought on by the COVID
          19 problem and nearly entirely rebuild our strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were able to attract and book appointments with prestigious businesses including{" "}
          <strong>FOX, JTI, Macy&apos;s, Swatch, Armani, The Guardian, and CBS</strong> because to
          our prompt response to the new problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          We set up more than 50 business meetings with potential clients from the SMB market, the
          event and entertainment industry, as well as other target audiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The open rate stayed above 25% throughout even the most trying times, which is an
          excellent standard.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>It&apos;s vital to be incisive and exact in your language: </strong>When you put
          enough effort into it, a few words can turn the tide of an entire campaign. As a result,
          spending time developing a sales offer that resonates with your prospects will pay off
          with a higher rate of favorable responses and more lucrative agreements. It will also help
          you get through the most trying circumstances because your potential customers won&apos;t
          want to overlook such an experienced vendor.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Flexibility: </strong>While addressing B2B difficulties, Bruce Lee&apos;s famous
          adage {'"'}Be the water{'"'} will be helpful. You must remain flexible, vigilant, and fast
          to adapt to new changes if you want to succeed. Therefore, even if everything is going
          well and your campaigns are succeeding, you should still create a Plan B and even a Plan C
          in case of an emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Test the Plan B strategy every time: </strong>It is insufficient to have a Plan B
          just on paper. You must confirm that it functions. As a result, you should bring your team
          together, discuss, and practice your backup plan to ensure that it will work when you need
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be responsive to market trends: </strong>On the market, nothing remains the same.
          It is constantly touched by a wide range of events, including economic shifts and
          epidemics.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Never hold off till the storm arrives: </strong>Before the effects of
          <em>force majeure </em>begin to have an influence on your company, you must be able to see
          the writing on the wall and begin protecting your campaigns.

          <strong>Challenges Encountered by NFT BRANDS INC. </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>The client reached out to us after facing the following issues:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Overextended contact data research: </strong>Although operating in quite a narrow
          niche, keeping its sales pipeline fueled with new contact data turned out to be a
          complicated and time-consuming process for NFT BRANDS INC..
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Complicated email outreach: </strong>The issues associated with gathering contact
          data often culminated into problems that ruined NFT BRANDS INC.&apos;s overall email
          strategy - a vital source of new B2B relationships and connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lack of consistency: </strong>With contact data research and email outreach in
          disarray, NFT BRANDS INC. faced difficulties in securing consistent software demos for
          potential buyers that in turn affected its ability to maintain a high conversion level and
          sustain growth.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1{")"} Data scraping </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As a first step, we dug into the client’s contact database and filtered out the best
          potential candidates. This process was immensely important since it was the principal
          aspect of the account-based marketing strategy necessary for building an organized sales
          process.
        </p>
        <p
          style={{
            border: "1px solid #eaeaea",
            padding: "1rem",
            fontSize: "1.1rem",
            backgroundColor: "#F8EDE6",
          }}
        >
          <strong>Why is it important? </strong>
          This is since a thorough scan of the client&aposs database and its segment-wise
          rearrangement helps in understanding the priorities. For example, you can create A-tier
          prospects {"("}those that perfectly fit the sales team and are ready for conversations
          {")"}, or B-tier prospects {"("}the ones needing more nurturing before getting started
          with sales
          {")"}, etc. This streamlined structure lets sales personnel navigate through their tasks
          and plan freely, thus accelerating the workflow and securing more closed deals at the end
          of each month.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to using available appointments, we started targeting new companies that could
          be interested in the client’s services. While converging our attention on countries having
          solid research facilities, e.g. the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Israel, the USA, and
          Switzerland, as part of our strategy, we focused on academic organizations pursuing
          innovative and reliable means of variety testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2{")"} Securing a steady flow of emails </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          With potential prospects clearly in our sight, we made sure that NFT BRANDS INC. was
          sending a steady volume of emails to verified addresses.
        </p>
        <p
          style={{
            border: "1px solid #eaeaea",
            padding: "1rem",
            fontSize: "1.1rem",
            backgroundColor: "#F8EDE6",
          }}
        >
          <strong>Why is it important? </strong>
          Given the fact that email spam filters pay attention to the sender’s domain performance
          and the way emails are sent, for keeping the Sender Score above 0, it&apos;s advisable not
          to cross the acceptable limit of messages that can be sent per day. At the same time,
          it&apos;s also necessary to increase the number of emails gradually to build up inbox
          capacity and improve the domain’s health. This is what is known as inbox warm-up, and the
          &apos;to-do&apos; list must unmistakably include it once a new business inbox is created.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3{")"} Template crafting </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After fixing our targets, we proceeded towards developing an email outreach strategy that
          would be most appropriate for NFT BRANDS INC. We had to be careful in our approach since
          creating email templates for academic organizations was different from the process of
          developing templates for seed companies. As the first step, we made a separate set of
          templates for EU academic societies.
        </p>
        <p
          style={{
            border: "1px solid #eaeaea",
            padding: "1rem",
            fontSize: "1.1rem",
            backgroundColor: "#F8EDE6",
          }}
        >
          <strong>Why is it important? </strong>
          When it comes to segmenting the target audience, it&apos;s well-nigh impossible to do it
          without considering the specific factors, both internal and external that may impact the
          workflow of the organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when it comes to plant variety, since every region has its unique conditions and
          goals, it&apos;s vital to make sure the templates mirror these goals and indicate that the
          product meets the requirements. Because academic organizations work with large volumes of
          scientific data, we at Leadingly made sure to compress the time taken to integrate them
          and make them usable for client’s software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our approach was straightforward: introducing the client’s offer swiftly and at the same
          time acknowledging the prospects’ contribution to the scientific database and also
          expressing our commitment to accelerate their achievements in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s obvious that academic organizations and research facilities want zero or no
          interruptions. It implies that an assurance of cleaner and less time-consuming data
          processing would interest them more than increasing profits or competitiveness. Thus they
          prefer vendors that are well-educated about their research directions and offer solutions
          specific to their needs and academic aspirations.

          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Within 3 months of our cooperation, we achieved the following results for NFT BRANDS INC.:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Weekly demos: </strong>With not a single week going without scheduling a demo
          with a prospect, it was indeed an incredibly satisfying result that further signified that
          the creative direction for academic societies paid off and was productive enough to build
          a stable demo calendar. We secured 114 demonstrations for the client in a total of 3
          months.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Increase in response rate: </strong>After launching an email outreach campaign,
          we observed an increase of over 20% in response rate. Given that 20% is the average
          performance benchmark for business inboxes, going beyond this indicator was a positive
          dynamic that only needs monitoring to sustain the growth momentum.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Refreshing database</strong>: If new challenges come on the way, it&apos;s
          pertinent to scrape your customer database and separate apples from oranges as some
          appointments would be more viable than others. Therefore, embarking on changes or adapting
          new strategies, it&apos;s prudent to take some time to review your appointments and
          earmark the ones that align perfectly with your new needs and targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Building a constant workflow</strong>: As consistency is the key to a successful
          email outreach campaign, it will be tactically wise to keep such messages flying to your
          recipients’ inboxes and you’ll have your share of incoming messages to work with.
          Naturally, it means that you should monitor your inboxes and secure
        </p>
        <p>
          perfect domain health to keep your Open Rate high. Here, you will feel the need for a
          competent mailbox engineer to work on your deliverability.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creativity matters</strong>: It&apos;s necessary to keep in mind that each segment
          of your target audience has specific preferences and it&apos;s only then you’re guaranteed
          to win your prospects over. In case your prospects contribute to the knowledge database
          via cases or articles, make sure to acknowledge that contribution and highlight how your
          product can assist your prospects in their work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Process each response</strong>: All responses are valuable and it would be
          judicious not to dump all negative emails into one folder. While some of them may be a
          definite “<em>NO</em>”, some may mean “<em>Maybe later</em>” — the difference is
          self-evident.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be methodical</strong>: Building a structure of folders and labels will help in
          making the most out of each interaction with your target audience.

          <strong>About MALA </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          MALA MALA works with a diverse coalition of partners and supporters, from major
          corporations and foundations to grassroots community groups. Our work advances thanks to
          these dynamic and generous partners.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>We also offer consultancy services in: </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our community is composed of an ecosystem of small, medium, large, and giant
          organizations. Small and medium-sized businesses stand to earn the most from our platform.
          Frequently, they lack the resources needed for marketing, a lobbyist to speak up for them
          in front of the state government, or human resources assistance to locate and hire
          competent staff. In those instances where they are unable to find a qualified candidate to
          fill the position, the chamber offers assistance to these businesses. They pick us to be a
          partner in their strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Larger businesses typically have that framework in place already. Hence they frequently
          collaborate with us in an effort to uphold responsible corporate behavior and promote a
          burgeoning economic movement. We can then continue doing our good deeds in the region.
          Furthermore, as many of their customers are also members of our organization, joining is a
          great way for them to maintain their good name and benefit the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>More time with potential customers </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am in charge of a team of recruiters that make sure MALA&apos;s membership keeps
          growing. They get in touch with potential donors and ask for an opportunity to explain the
          benefits of MALA membership.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, our personnel had to go through a drawn-out process before they could speak with
          potential donors. They needed to target, qualify, connect, and then try to set up an
          appointment. Overall, the time spent on outreach accounted for around 65% of their time.
          According to this, just 35% of their time was really spent speaking with prospects.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Better and Specialized Service </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Leadingly then emailed me with details on their B2B lead generation service. The fact that
          they offered a more thorough, sophisticated, and knowledgeable service than the previous
          company gave me confidence that they would keep their promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leadingly currently manages our outbound process. I provided documents to the messaging
          development process and gave a quick interview explanation of our value proposition.
          Leadingly created the messaging and executed the outbound campaigns on our behalf. Through
          our dashboard, I can see the quantity of research contacts they&apos;ve identified, the
          number of emails sent, the number of emails opened and replied to, as well as the content
          of the messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using our CRM system, I assess each incoming response to see if we already have a profile
          for that person or not. If a record is found, we assign a person to that account so that I
          can contact that person and ask them to arrange an appointment after receiving the
          message.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a prospect responds, {'"'}Not Now,{'"'} we follow the same process; we simply advance
          our calendar by a few months. If they decline a meeting, we usually update our CRM system
          for a six-month period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The marketing materials, web presence, and reporting capabilities of Leadingly have earned
          my utmost satisfaction. I&apos;m quite pleased with the team&apos;s communication skills.
          I always receive a quick response when I email our account manager with an update or a
          query.

        </h3>
        <p>
          As of now, I have been quite happy with Leadingly&apos;s results and support. Outbound
          message open rates currently average 65 to 70 percent, far above the sector average. In
          the six weeks that we have been working together, we have been able to reduce the time
          spent hunting for new prospects from 65% to 50%. Now that they will have more time, our
          sales team may talk to potential customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We did have a method that functioned before, but it wasn&apos;t as efficient as it is now.
          Consider it like a cake; our sales team had already completed the baking, but Leadingly
          assisted us in adding the icing.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were able to boost the amount of possibilities in our funnel and direct that activity
          toward beneficial outcomes with the help of Leadingly. Keep in mind that everything
          transpired rather rapidly. Not even months or quarters have passed since the results were
          expected. It is clear that they have expanded rapidly in just six weeks. They have already
          delivered, and they continue to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Future chances in our industry will abound, and Leadingly will continue to lead us there
          successfully, in my opinion. I don&apos;t know what the future holds, but I count on
          Leadingly to grasp the market&apos;s fecundity and carry on our hunting, farming, and
          research on our behalf.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still find Leadingly to be a really helpful tool in my day-to-day work. I agree with the
          technique they&apos;re using as well as the communication and technological instruments
          that maintain their operation efficiently. It is cutting edge in terms of facilitating the
          tried and-true way of business development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;ve already stated that I aim to create a {'"'}die-hard fan{'"'} atmosphere among
          MALA members. Well, Leadingly has my unwavering support and my highest recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Businesses in the area can benefit greatly from joining MALA, including networking
          opportunities, reliable advice, and HR help. Learn more and sign up.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you represent an organization like MALA and are looking for ways to increase the amount
          of new members you are attracting, Leadingly can help.

          software is delivered by enabling businesses to quickly design, deploy, and manage

          <strong>Problems faced by Mobility Intel </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          US SaaS B2B solution provider Mobility Intel started considering expanding into the APAC
          market and wanted to reduce time to market and outsource outbound lead generation to a
          company. It has 350 partners and thousands of active clients in 87 countries, mostly from
          inbound sources. Following Leadingly&apos;s prospecting and appointment-setting, the
          Mobility Intel sales team started nurturing and completing deals. The client gave us the
          following set of duties:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Outsourcing pipeline generation: </strong>In spite of having a full-stack sales
          team and almost 2,000 people, the client needs more staff to quickly enter new markets.
          When a business has to expand quickly, it can outsource pipeline generation to a different
          party. This keeps the employee count constant while the company expands. Mobility Intel
          wanted to supply their large sales force with a consistent stream of appointments that
          were qualified.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Augment business visibility</strong>: There aren&apos;t many high-quality
          competitors to Mobility Intel that can offer a comparable product in terms of value, cost,
          and accessibility. However, in general, growing your business won&apos;t happen
          automatically just because you&apos;re a creative leader in the field of modern
          application platforms. Building your company&apos;s exposure is essential for success if
          you want to stand out from the competition and attract more clients. Leadingly&apos;s goal
          was to attract as many potential clients as possible by expanding its awareness among
          people who had before questioned the necessity for cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Sales templates: </strong>Notwithstanding the email outreach approaches
          Mobility Intel had used before Leadingly&apos;s intervention, a set of fresh ones had to
          be developed for exploring a new market. At least one set of templates with a specific
          value proposition for different titles has to be developed before an outreach campaign
          starts.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          When we were about to begin, Mobility Intel decided to switch from the European to the
          Asia-Pacific markets, and it took them 1.5 months to put another team together. We have
          three months to fulfill the contract&apos;s requirement of 90 appointments. With only half
          as much time, it was clear that the final result would be less. However, Leadingly was
          confident that they would deliver the tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Building a pipeline for APAC </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of Mobility Intel&apos;s significant market presence, even APAC prospects would{" "}
          respond that they were familiar with them. They collaborate with businesses of all sizes{" "}
          to skillfully handle any crucial applications. Leadingly immediately began scheduling the
          calls using its can&apos;t-miss prospecting method. Leadingly focused in targeting the
          predominantly large corporate companies. When dealing with account-based sales in B2B
          companies, it’s essential to get:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Well-defined ICP: </strong>The well-established ICP of Mobility Intel made it
          easier for Leadingly to determine the industry that would be the best fit for it, the
          accounts to contact, and the important stakeholders to identify.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Targeting appropriate stakeholders: </strong>Mobility Intel&apos;s sales force
          does not have to focus on B2B marketers as they create corporate SaaS solutions. Instead,
          you should concentrate on IT staff and those in charge of application development. In
          account-based sales, you often target a number of decision makers rather than just one
          important individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fully-personalized focus: </strong>There are countless possibilities on social
          media platforms to learn what your important stakeholders are interested in and talking
          about. Deep lead research made it possible for Leadingly SDRs to customize their messages
          and reach key stakeholders easily and swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Keeping communication channel open with Mobility Intel </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Understanding a prospective partner&apos;s internal operations will help you make sure
          your lead generation efforts are in line with how they conduct business. Mobility Intel is
          a sizable business with a well-established method of operation. Here’s how the Leadingly
          team responded to the challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Maintaining steady contact: </strong>The effectiveness of any outsourced
          appointment setup depends heavily on ongoing communication between the client and the
          service provider. Regular communication makes handling challenges that constantly arise
          along the route more successful. Account executive Mary was always available and worked to
          find a compromise that benefits both sides without interfering with workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            It&apos;s also necessary to adjust with the client&apos;s internal processes:
          </strong>
          Mobility Intel&apos;s approval procedure is very drawn out and it took some time to
          approve the Leadingly team&apos;s requests for adjustments to locations, titles, and other
          things. The Leadingly team members tried their best not to slow down their workflow and
          maintain a steady pace despite being aware that big businesses are less adaptable in their
          decision making process.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be considerate to client&apos;s needs: </strong>Leadingly&apos;s SDRs received a
          {"'"}special request{"'"} from Mobility Intel that sought a structuring of the lead and
          appointment chart according to their specifications. The Leadingly team may then directly
          input all the lead data into Mobility Intel CRM in this manner and its sales and research
          team has been working particularly hard on this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Holding the ground</strong>: However, there can be requests that Leadingly is
          unable to deliver, such as pre-qualification calls. This is not something we normally do,
          so we agreed that we would follow our normal prospecting process and book calls for them,
          and they would qualify the prospects on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our experience we&apos;ve learned that communication is the cornerstone of the
          strongest alliances. We constantly approach our clients&apos; demands with the knowledge
          that it&apos;s not only about finishing the task but also about providing them with what
          they require to continue going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the reason why you prioritize listening with attention and responding promptly,
          regardless of whether you&apos;re seeking for appointments or just want to discuss your
          marketing plan. Never hesitate to get in touch with us at any moment for your queries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding a new companion is successful so long as there is open communication. There are a
          lot of things to learn and take into account, from comprehending their sales process to
          their perspectives on teamwork, including:
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What are the major turning points? </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>What is the duration of each step? </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>How many individuals or divisions are involved? </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This will aid you in finding chances for mutually beneficial collaboration between your
          business and theirs. And without open and constant dialogue, these questions cannot be
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Adjusting templates </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Leadingly used the outbound email marketing approach for Mobility Intel. For each title,
          the team has a collection of email templates with a specific value proposition. We
          didn&apos;t explore alternative strategies because this one was successful right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the Leadingly staff had to manage numerous active outreach efforts that were
          underway simultaneously in 5–6 nations. Because of the many methods of communication, the
          various time zones, and the demands from the product side, it wasn&apos;t simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, although Australia and Indonesia required a different strategy, Hong Kong,
          Singapore, and Malaysia were willing to engage. To keep from losing sight of what may
          result in a possible prospect from this GEO, the creative team had to alter the wording
          and tweak email templates.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          In spite of a difficult onboarding and difficulties along the road, Leadingly met its
          sales targets in the period allotted:

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Imbibing both hard and soft skills: </strong>The Leadingly team is confident in
          producing outstanding results because they believe in the dualism of hard talents and soft
          abilities. Their extensive experience demonstrates this. Hard skills are only one aspect
          of the equation, though. Salespeople must be able to communicate clearly, anticipate
          issues, and be ready for challenges if they are to succeed. Equally important are quick
          thinking, resilience, and response times.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Overarching importance of communication</strong>: Without team harmony, which in
          turn is impossible without two-way communication, high and stable performance is
          unattainable. Mobility Intel has always responded quickly to inquiries and set tasks in a
          transparent manner. Finding high-quality appointments, developing intriguing and
          captivating templates, and scheduling appointments on time have all been accomplished with
          precision by Leadingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Every issue is a challenge</strong>: Leadingly&apos;s outlook is to accept the
          arising problems as challenges that in turn brings out the creative best. As it was at the
          beginning of the year, the client&apos;s technical issues caused the project&apos;s
          onboarding to be delayed. However, we were eager to take on this challenging task of
          meeting the dates and goals without sacrificing quality. Tight deadlines are not a problem
          for success as long as your strategy is working.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Right partner, faster results: </strong>The literature on outsourcing sales
          acquisition partners frequently advise clients not to hold out for instant gratification.
          The key takeaway is that it takes a lot of time for a new staff to learn the ropes and
          start producing results. A learning curve might in fact last for up to 90 days. However,
          once the project had actually begun, collaborating with Mobility Intel didn&apos;t require
          a lengthy onboarding period because Leadingly is fairly familiar with the SaaS market.
          Collaboration becomes easy and fruitful when two professional entities come into contact.

          <strong>Problems faced by Metaverse Plus </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The brand required a consistent flow of clients because the sector depends largely on
          partnerships for success. However, it is usual for companies to use a more conventional
          method of lead generation, which involves calling decision-makers directly. Modern
          techniques like marketing automation and email outreach were not utilized in this
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, the customer only used PPC marketing, which is a time-and-money consuming
          strategy. Sales managers must spend hours setting & optimizing campaigns, creating
          content, adjusting strategies and getting to the right people before the proper person can
          be located and persuaded to block out time from their schedule for a conversation. Sales
          managers typically only succeed in reaching their prospects after 8 tries.

          <strong>How Metaverse Plus Increased in Sales by 200% | Leadingly</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Metaverse Plus began considering the alternative methods of generating and contacting
          prospects after realizing that the time and costs associated with PPC ads did not justify
          their expenditure.

          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>
            Our database has grown as a result of the numerous appointments we obtained for clients
            we were previously unaware of.{" "}
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When we first started working with MetaversePlus, Leadingly gave us the following
          assignments:
        </p>
        <p>Gathering appointments;</p>
        <p>Increasing email deliverability;</p>
        <p>Optimizing sender score;</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          The Ideal Customer Profile {"("}ICP{")"} of Metaverse Plus was given to us which focused
          on C-Level executives of large brands & companies in any state.
        </p>

        >
          <strong>Why is it important? </strong>The ICP is a standard form that our clients fill out
          with pertinent data including the location, industry verticals, revenue totals, staff
          counts, and titles of the main stakeholders in the enterprises of their target clientele.
          Industry-specific additional qualifiers can include information on recent reorganizations,
          corporate technology, business finances, and even the size of a company&apos;s
          headquarters. It is hard to alter email templates, adjust the approach, or create a
          suitable commercial pitch without the ICP. The first stage in assuring the effectiveness
          of B2B lead generation and email marketing is for the customer to comprehend their own
          ICP. We move forward to lead research, validation, analysis, and segmenting after
          receiving the ICP from our client. Along with a few specific criteria supplied by the
          customer, the following criteria were the main ones used in the search for MetaversePlus:
        </p>
        <p>Number of employees:</p>
        <p>Active hiring:</p>
        <p>Annual revenue.</p>
        <p>
          We started a quality evaluation procedure after receiving the business lead data to make
          sure that each of the companies that matched the client&apos;s ICP was active and prepared
          for engagement.

          <strong>How Metaverse Plus Increased in Sales by 200% | Leadingly</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We did that by evaluating the prospects&apos; websites, LinkedIn profiles, and social
          media accounts. We completed the list of appointments by eliminating all the prospects who
          were already in the Metaverse space.

          <strong>2{")"} Boosting email deliverability </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Metaverse Plus gave Leadingly the assignment of creating an Outreach program for all the
          newly acquired B2B prospects in order to engage the growing amount of new appointments
          that were being generated.
        </p>
        <p>This comprised of:</p>
        <p>1. Contacting potential customers on the client&apos;s behalf;</p>
        <p>2. Arranging and analyzing answers from intended recipients;</p>
        <p>3. Fostering pertinent discussions with potential clients who are interested;</p>

        <p>6. Sending the client the prospects who are prepared to make a call;</p>
        <p>7. Directing prospects who have difficult or technical questions to the customer.</p>
        <p>
          A professional copywriter was tasked with modifying email templates and changing the
          special value proposition to speak directly to the needs of the prospect. The SDR team set
          up the proper sending configuration on the clients&apos; mailboxes and prepared a
          timetable for sending emails in the meanwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the campaign went live, we closely watched its effectiveness to guarantee excellent
          deliverability levels.

        >
          <strong>Why is it important? </strong>The chance of your emails being labeled as spam is a
          recurring problem when starting an email outreach campaign. It occurs when the
          recipient&apos;s email service provider flags certain of the message&apos;s terms as
          spam-triggers or when the sender domain&apos;s Sender Score is low.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SDR handled the campaign&apos;s appointment setting and no-show recovery services as
          well as processing all incoming responses. We organized the mailboxes and divided up all
          correspondence threads into the following categories to improve productivity:

          efforts on prospects who were prepared for engagement.

        </p>

          <strong>Why is it important? </strong>The deliverability of your emails may be impacted by
          a number of {'"'}hidden faults{'"'} on your domain, which could lessen the priority of
          your messages&apos; transmission and cause them to land in spam folders rather than
          inboxes. To prevent that, we always suggest to our clients to have their domain sender
          score and business mailbox evaluated by one of our qualified professionals.

          <strong> </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Never rely solely on PPC ads to generate B2B appointments: </strong>Your chances
          of setting up an appointment or closing a deal increase if you do not directly contact
          your prospects are slim.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>A tailored strategy is needed for B2B lead generation and outreach:</strong>Always
          keep your target audience, their requirements, and their objectives in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            It’s always sensible to explore new tools and means to improve your lead generation
          </strong>
          : If your competitors aren&apos;t using new tools and methods to increase lead generation,
          then you are gaining a significant advantage over them and it is always worthwhile to look
          into them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>It takes a long time to qualify and process prospective customers:</strong>This
          being the case, hiring a professional staff to handle that portion of your workflow will

        <p>
          Luxury Partners offers products and services with an emphasis on enhancing the built
          environment. It targets the inefficiencies and negative environmental effects typical of
          the construction industry and seeks to provide a new, superior method of jobsite health

          <strong>Problems faced by client </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          The customer was well-stacked with ideas, resources, and knowledge. Nonetheless, it needed
          help with the following things in order to implement their ideas effectively:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Thoroughly-targeted lead generating: </strong>The client provided a list of
          somewhat complex requirements that had to be followed from qualifier to qualifier. As
          generic databases and cursory research were insufficient to meet that need, the customer
          began looking for specialists who could create distinctive, hand-curated lead data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Workflow organization: </strong>The Luxury Partners outreach procedure lacked the
          framework required to maximize the client&apos;s insights and ideas. This exposed the need
          for an acquisition partner with vast expertise in streamlining cold outreach processes and
          constructing corporate inboxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Spam issues: </strong>The customer wasn&apos;t happy with the present
          deliverability and sought ways to boost openings and ensure that all business emails were
          delivered to their intended recipients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data gathering: </strong>Fully aware of the importance of viewing and comparing,
          the client wanted to measure and compare stats to get a clear picture of the viable
          solutions and strategies.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Creating a transparent lead generation method: </strong>The client provided our
          research team with a huge chunk of search data since their Ideal Customer Profile was so
          comprehensive. Targeting entrepreneur-driven real estate developers and specialized
          healthcare providers, we had to start our lead research from zero and drastically reduce
          it down to meet the specific requirements provided by the client. Luxury Partners was
          searching for appointments with a specific hierarchy, behavior, and state of development.
          The client targeted locations all around the United States, with a focus on {'"'}
          Cinderella
          {'"'} cities, or places where firms had to contend with astronomically high construction
          costs and need a really flexible value proposition. That level of specificity offered
          advantages and disadvantages alike. 1. We obtained as many distinct search qualifiers as
          we could, which made it simpler for us to distinguish between like appointments and
          unrelated appointments and select the most pertinent ones. 2. At the same time, because of
          the extra measures we had to take to make sure that our hand-selected appointments are
          100% feasible, the research took twice as long as usual. These &apos;extras&apos; included
          SDR qualification and thorough activity research.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Launching an outreach campaign: </strong>To maximize the use of our recently
          created lead database, Leadingly developed a brand-new outreach strategy. The campaign
          took on many different strands, and we created a unique set of templates for brand-new
          appointments, website visits, and segments from the client&apos;s prior lead database. Our
          copywriting team created a number of sequences with various variable combinations in order
          to thoroughly catch the interest of our prospects. We pursued our introductory emails with
          three to five qualifying questions to make sure We were comfortable enough to schedule a
          meeting. It&apos;s important to note that because we were in a very conservative business,
          some of the prospects we worked with preferred to call us right away rather than exchange
          emails. Dealing with prospects who Are ready to speak with you is incredibly positive,
          although it took some getting used to. In order to avoid phoning prospects in our email
          marketing, we established a unique method of information sharing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Troubleshooting spam issues: </strong>For tracking the client&apos;s progress, we
          used{" "}
          <span
            style={{
              textDecoration: "underline",
            }}
          >
            Folderly
          </span>
          . Additionally, we increased open and response rates while lowering the likelihood of
          being designated as spam by using our freshly created and warmed-up mailboxes. We were
          able to develop a consistent sending pattern and stabilize our client&apos;s Sender Score
          thanks to an in-depth investigation of email deliverability and our understanding of
          mailbox optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Data accumulation: </strong>The lead data and statistics we provided in our weekly
          and monthly reports allowed the customer to implement Luxury Partners&apos; initiatives
          more effectively and boost the company&apos;s potential.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          We received thorough information about our three key areas by the end of the first month
          of our collaboration, as well as the comprehendible statistics, 96 appointments, and a 47%
          response rate. After developing a consistent outreach approach and sending personalized
          B2B emails, we scheduled 96 appointments. Such a fruitful outcome is a clear sign of a
          professionally designed research and outreach strategy. When their interest in the
          client&apos;s distinctive value proposition was at its highest, we targeted the correct
          appointments at the appropriate development stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          We were also able to highlight the most advantageous features of the client&apos;s offer,{" "}
          thanks to our A|B testing and customization, which opened the door for B2B connections.
          Along with the 96 appointments we arranged, we managed to maintain about a dozen ongoing
          dialogues each month, giving our client blossoming deals for the near future. The average
          positive response rate increased, which shows that new templates are opened and used more
          frequently. The quantity of negative feedback is also a reliable indicator.
        </p>
        <p>
          The client&apos;s email outreach procedure was so effective that an inside sales team
          could be hired. Luxury Partners lacked a sales team to handle and maintain sales momentum
          before working with Leadingly. But once a pattern was identified and put into practise,
          the customer had the knowledge needed to control the process on their own.

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          This case demonstrates how knowing your Ideal Customer Profile may have a significant
          impact. It would be simpler for you to teach your outsourced sales team about search
          qualifiers if you were better knowledgeable of your target audience and had conducted more
          thorough research. Because research teams may require extra time to get the proper
          appointments, be as specific as you can with your criteria. The outcome, nevertheless,
          will be worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding very specialized appointments can occasionally need you to develop a unique
          strategy for conducting research and gathering information. SDRs and marketing specialists
          should be included in your study since they can help with lead qualification and
          verification. You will be able to secure more appointments if you put more effort into
          your search.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the next step, you can employ an outside team to interpret the data, launch campaigns,
          establish sales tactics, and create optimized mailboxes if you have gathered sufficient
          data and information about the markets of your target audience. Your performance
          statistics and metrics will be available to you in a few months, allowing you to decide
          whether you&apos;re prepared to hire your own sales crew or not.

          was our responsibility to assist Global Geeks with things like:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Accelerating growth: </strong>The client understood the necessity to create a
          fruitful and effective channel in order to extend the brand&apos;s influence to a new
          market. However, making such a choice requires extensive knowledge and investigation. The
          Global Geeks team needed fresh perspectives and well chosen lead data to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Meager internal resources: Global Geeks </strong>sought the help from outside
          experts who could help with creating and managing the new campaign rather than putting the
          burden on its staff.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Examined the ICP in detail: </strong>Our team examined the client&apos;s Ideal
          Customer Profile to determine what kinds of information were missing from it to determine
          why the present targeting wasn&apos;t producing enough high-value appointments.
          Additionally, we explored the value proposition of Global Geeks. This part of the research
          was necessary to establish the key definitive features that set the client apart from the
          competition and figure out how to implement those features in its future campaigns. Since
          the solution was designed for providers, the Global Geeks ICP proved to be rather
          challenging. Its training management system was curated to assist these businesses in
          enhancing both their operational efficiency and the way in which they train their
          customers. With our subsequent actions, we address this.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Customized research: </strong>We tasked a capable Leadingly researcher with
          investigating several markets and businesses in quest of the ideal match.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Global Geeks ICP: </strong>In this step, hand-selected data had to be used, and it
          had to be mixed into a variety of data sources, including social media sites like LinkedIn
          and AngelList and more specialized sources like Xing.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Template crafting: </strong>We provided our copywriters with the knowledge on our
          objectives, our industry, and target market. They used it to create a set of specialized
          cold email templates. We selected a 4-email cadence since it appeared to be the most
          effective at educating prospects and encouraging them to reply.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Project management: </strong>Right from the beginning of implementation of the new
          campaign, an AM and an SDR from Leadingly have been keeping an eye on it. We were able to
          maintain order, guarantee the greatest results, and quickly adjust to the changes thanks
          to this. The Global Geeks team was free to process fresh warm appointments and move them
          along to the appointment-setting step in the interim.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Being successful in the market: </strong>Encouraging outcomes were obtained from
          our market research and advertising initiatives. In the first few months of working with
          Global Geeks, we were able to identify and convert over 27 high-value prospects into deals
          in just 3 months. It was a remarkable result and a solid proof that our targeting and
          campaigns were founded on reliable research data and were successful in grabbing the
          attention of the target audience, especially given that each new deal with the client that
          perfectly fits the ICP drives significant amounts of revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Responses mapping: </strong>For giving the client transparent insights and a
          better knowledge of how the campaign should be evolved, we supplied the maximum amount of
          detail regarding the replies that were obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>New territories explored: </strong>We identified lucrative markets in Austria,
          Switzerland, and Belgium through our research. The Global Geeks solution turned out to be
          nearly unique in these markets, which increased the likelihood of landing new business and
          loyal clients. Right now, we&apos;re still working with Global Geeks to maximize the
          potential of these fresh markets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Growth achieved: </strong>Global Geeks began expanding quickly after creating a
          streamlined and transparent methodology and effective advertising. The business acquired
          the chances and assets required for growing the core staff, set up a CRM to organize the
          lead flow, and kept collaborating with the Leadingly team to achieve even greater success
          in sales and project management.

          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Begin with your ICP: </strong>While creating a product, it&apos;s important to
          create a clear picture of the individual or business will help. The location and business
          objectives should all be noted. Your chances of discovering your ideal client without
          having to repeatedly rewrite email templates and rethink outreach initiatives increase the
          more particular you are.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Avoid using the same email template: </strong>You can&apos;t make cold emails
          persuasive by copying and pasting the body content and changing a few details {"("}such as
          the recipient&apos;s name or the name of the company{")"}. Make it visible that you
          respect each of your prospects as a person and are prepared to develop a tailored solution
          to address their pain points by creating new material, adding relevance, and doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>There will always to new markets to explore: </strong> Even if you feel that all
          categories are already occupied and that dealing with competition is unavoidable, you
          should still look into potential new business ventures. Although your answer might not be
          exceptional in your immediate market, it will end up being highly sought for in other
          areas. The best way to learn is to always search for new areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Team up with experts: </strong>If your team is tiny but productive and you want
          your business to develop naturally rather than artificially, be careful how you approach
          your jobs. Your human resources will get overworked and you&apos;ll miss out on excellent
          sales prospects if you give your sales representatives and researchers too much work.

          <strong>About Web3Pay </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          For PSPs, banks, developers, and businesses, Web3Pay provides a market platform with the
          aim of creating fresh financial experiences. Businesses in the banking, energy, gambling,
          and financial services sectors stand to gain from this platform&apos;s increased
          connection and transaction quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Problems </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When attempting to promote the Web3Pay platform to its target market, the customer ran
          into the following issues:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lead investigation that is laborious: </strong>The financial technology industry
          has always been quite complicated. The client required help and resources to obtain
          relevant public data so that it could find clients keen to take part in open banking and
          explore new digital opportunities. To conduct such research alone must take a lot of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lack of knowledge in cold outreach: </strong>The client had created Token.io
          accounts on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms, and had a
          significant online presence. But for the company, writing cold emails presented a new set
          of difficulties. So, the client needed a qualified staff with campaign and email
          production experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Missing out on large organizations: </strong>Web3Pay benefited greatly from having
          large corporations as clients, but they needed help with message creation and title
          research. To avoid missing an opportunity to improve the lead database, Web3Pay had to
          find and research novel ways of connecting with the suitable professionals at the proper
          moment.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>What we did </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Navigating that extra mile </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After learning about the client&apos;s primary points of discomfort, we started addressing
          them step-by-step. We decided to introduce Web3Pay to significant organizations as our
          first step. On the other hand, innovative digital products and services have the downside
          of being challenging to summarize in a single sentence. Our goal was to develop
          connections with people who could explain the many peculiarities and distinctive features
          of the Web3Pay product to a decision-making group. To do this, we needed to conduct the
          following actions:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Scrutinizing client&apos;s product: </strong>This is a standard phase of any
          project we work on. We delve deeply into the features and specifics of the client&apos;s
          product or service. Our sales team got in touch with the experts at Web3Pay and asked for
          any marketing materials that were accessible so that we could understand what they were
          going to give and how they were going to achieve it. We did thorough research across the
          board, including presentations and early sales pitches, to understand the brand voice and
          how potential customers perceive it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Overseas Targets: </strong>We targeted companies in the UK, Ireland, Switzerland,
          France, Germany, Estonia, Latvia, Italy, Luxembourg, Belgium, and other countries,
          concentrating on the industries that could benefit from increased digital transactions.
          But we also required some guidance from seasoned professionals from a range of industries,
          including oil and energy, utilities, cryptocurrencies, renewable energy, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Granular research: </strong>We researched appointments before conducting a product
          analysis. We took a thorough strategy, scouring several databases to find the most
          relevant companies because few organizations were able to verify all the categories. By
          routinely engaging with the base and completing double qualification utilizing both our
          SDRs and the client&apos;s SDRs, we stayed in touch with the customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Accelerating the momentum </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Asking for referrals </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sure that our initiative is dynamic, we asked potential decision-makers directly
          if they were qualified to speak about the products of Web3Pay and used referral templates
          for more precision. In case we were speaking to the wrong person, We asked for directions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Creating Templates </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          After compiling a solid list of appointments, we worked on developing an engaging message.
          Our email campaign served two purposes: to outline the benefits of open banking and to{" "}
          introduce the concept to potential clients of the client in case they were not already
          aware of it. We also took care to include facts and data to show why this is a trustworthy
          way to conduct safe transactions rather than merely a fad.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Building an outbound channel </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We launched our campaigns after creating the templates and started nurturing prospects to
          encourage them to set up a call with Web3Pay&apos;s SDRs. After getting a favorable
          response from a prospect, we set a time slot and handed the prospect on to the
          client&apos;s sales representative along with all the templates and resources we used.
        </p>

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>The undermentioned objectives for Web3Pay were accomplished by our team:</p>
        <p>
          Our dependable and efficient sales funnel produces four to seven reservations at the end
          of each month. This is a positive development because we were able to schedule meetings
          with various large companies that employ more than 5000 people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developing and communicating with this particular target group requires a lot of effort,
          Therefore booking even one appointment after just one month is a noteworthy achievement.
          We organized more than 50 meetings for Web3Pay in total, bringing the client new business
          opportunities from Europe and expanding their network. Among the options we provided,
          there were sizable businesses eager to examine open banking with the client&apos;s
          assistance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our client was provided with in-depth knowledge on their target markets, customer demands,
          and perceptions of Web3Pay. Such feedback could not have been gathered if a honest and
          comfortable rapport had not been built with prospective clients.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>It&apos;s crucial to know both the product and the buyer</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can present your product more persuasively if you know it well. Spend time examining
          your products and services from a variety of angles, and keep in mind that certain
          advantages are prioritized in one business but not in another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Always stay prepared to share explanations </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As your service grows more unique, your lead research and targeting will get
          proportionately more challenging. You are responsible for guiding them through the
          purchasing process because your audience is still learning about the new benefits and
          possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Collaborate with experts </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are unfamiliar with cold outreach and developing external channels, it is advisable
          to choose a partner who can help you do market research, test various outbound approaches,
          increase your sales with more value, and give your company with a lasting reputation in
          the industry.

          <strong>About BPM Advisors </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          For its clients, BPM Advisors, a provider of renewable energy services, focuses on
          projects that reduce usage. BPM Advisors often works with clients who utilize large
          commercial or industrial units and have significant energy bills. The company offers
          solutions like LED lighting and solar power to help businesses become more energy
          efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m Matt Fasolini, and I work with BPM Advisors, a provider of clean energy services
          as the Chief Operating Officer. With solutions like LED lighting and solar electricity, we
          concentrate on consumption reduction programmes for our clients, assisting businesses in
          becoming more energy efficient. Usual clients are those who employ sizable commercial or
          industrial equipment and have substantial energy costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sales is one of my primary duties at BPM Advisors. Our approach to sales used to be
          extremely traditional. We would contact them by looking through our contact list. But
          eventually, our Rolodex was empty. We were aware that we needed to modify our sales
          strategy. Thankfully, Leadingly responded at that point.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Additionally, we offer consultancy services in: </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We developed an Ideal Customer Profile {"("}ICP{")"} with Leadingly so that we could
          target the appropriate businesses and then reach those prospects when they were most
          likely to make a choice. The Leadingly research team then searched for businesses that fit
          our ICP and discovered all the information required to launch an email campaign that
          targets those clients, enhancing our lead generation and scheduling more appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The majority of our meetings are face-to-face, and Leadingly has been exceptionally
          helpful in locating many appointments in our neighborhood. We&apos;ve raised our lead
          production by more than 50%, and the number of appointments generated is excellent. Our
          pipeline possibilities have been weighted according to where they are in the transaction
          stage; opportunities that are close to the end of the deal stage have seen increases of
          $6–$7 million.
        </p>
        <p>That&apos;s a pretty darn ROI.</p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s from here our team takes over. Since the majority of our clients aren&apos;t
          specialists in sustainable energy, our process begins with education. We simplify the
          difficulty by serving as their Chief Energy Officer. After that, we move on to the audit
          stage, followed by the solution stage, proposal stage, and finally the sales stage.

        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>It&apos;s a challenge to create &apos;that&apos; sense of urgency </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Trying to elicit an emotional feeling of urgency from the customer that will drive them to
          make a decision is one of the major issues we confront.
        </p>
        <p>
          For instance, we frequently advise customers to make modifications to their lighting as a
          simple approach to start saving money.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, most buyers don&apos;t consider lighting to be important. If they could, they
          would delay it until every light is out. Instead of seeing it as an investment that would
          generate income, they frequently view it as a pure capital improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, we&apos;ve discovered that proper lighting greatly affects operations,
          particularly in manufacturing facilities. Since they can see better and complete their
          work more quickly, employees are happy. With our assistance, one factory discovered that
          their rework rate significantly lowered, saving them almost $250,000.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it is still difficult to create the sense of urgency required to seal the sale.
          Buyers ultimately purchase when they are prepared to do so. Despite your best efforts, you
          can&apos;t make them do what you want. Nonetheless, you may nudge them and make sure
          you&apos;re there when they&apos;re prepared to decide. In order to do that, you need to
          generate more appointments, identify the people who are likely to make the choice, and
          time your arrival
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>A modern strategy for a legacy company </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Buyers&apos; way of purchasing has changed: </strong> Before a salesperson ever
          gets involved, the majority of their research has been done online. We are implementing a
          SaaS sales model for our offline firm in terms of inbound and outbound marketing as well
          as lead generation because B2B sales call for a novel strategy. We won&apos;t scale as
          quickly because we&apos;re not an internet or SaaS-type company. However, it is quite
          useful to look at how these companies create appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>We strive to become a dependable advisor: </strong> We aim to execute the role of
          a trustworthy advisor and demonstrate to potential clients that we have the knowledge and
          experience necessary to take care of their needs. In other words, we produce a lot of
          videos and upload them to websites like YouTube and Vimeo in addition to our own. To
          demonstrate how we might assist potential clients, we develop case studies. We also use
          social media, including Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. We&apos;re still learning how
          to use these channels, so we&apos;re doing it by trial and error. The outcomes are
          improving though.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>It’s essential to use the right tools in the sales process:</strong> Previously,
          we managed our pipeline using an Excel spreadsheet. However, it was inefficient, difficult
          to use, and lacked the data we required. We currently use Pipedrive as our CRM since it is
          easy to use, has a wonderful user experience, and is also reasonably priced. Additionally,
          it integrates with MailChimp, which we utilize to distribute our newsletter and build a
          reputation as a reliable source.

          <strong>A new journey with Leadingly </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          As we&apos;ve worked with Leadingly to enhance our ICP, focusing less on the kickers and
          more on the appointments that can ensure the greatest value from our service, the quantity
          of appointments has increased, which is crucial in any sales process. Furthermore, the
          quality has also improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the beginning, working with Leadingly has been joyful and simple. They have been
          accommodating to our needs and prompt in responding to any inquiries. We have a modest
          budget to outsource a lot of marketing because we are a small company with limited
          resources. But we discovered that partnering with Leadingly was affordable and produced
          the outcomes we needed.

        </p>
        <p>
          We have benefited immensely from Leadingly&apos;s assistance in terms of lead creation,
          conversation starters, and meeting setup. That relieves a lot of our workload. In all
          honesty, making cold calls is the last thing we want to do. We excel at the interpersonal
          side; that isn&apos;t our area of strength.

          <strong>About Shri Genesis </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Founded in 2005 and based in California, Shri Genesis is software development platform
          with high-profile angel investors supporting the privately held business. To enhance their
          sales development process, Shri Genesis turned to Leadingly for a new reliable supply of
          quality appointments.
        </p>
        <p>Sales goals are Outperformed by 200% for Shri Genesis exceeding clients expectations</p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Problems that plagued Shri Genesis </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Shri Genesis- was in hunt for someone to streamline the lead generation process for them
          after they developed a new software they wanted to market. Here is how Leadingly handled
          the situation over the course of an 8-month project.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Product consciousness: </strong>As Leadingly investigated more, it became apparent
          that the issue wasn&apos;t a lack of desire, but rather that people weren&apos;t aware of
          the offering. In order to expand into new markets in Europe in addition to the US and
          Canada, Shri Genesis, which was launched in 2005, ran out of word-of-mouth strategies and
          required a marketing plan that focused on results. It seemed clear that Shri Genesis would
          be a very helpful online tool for researchers and b2b companies. But in this case, they
          simply needed to spread the news of their launch more widely.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Prospecting: </strong>Shri Genesis lacked a reliable source of qualified
          appointments they could use. Their current plan was to delegate it to their own sales
          representatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Email templates: </strong>Based lead personalization research Leadingly found that
          whatever Shri Genesis had before must have to be modified and improved. The core of
          Leadingly&apos;s lead generation services, email outreach, routinely changes email
          templates to address problems with prospect engagement, CTAs, email deliverability, and
          spam filters.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>What we did</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          A quick review will show how the Leadingly team came up with ideal solutions for Shri
          Genesis for creating a sales pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Prospecting </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          As Shri Genesis already had a database and devoted customers, the Leadingly team
          didn&apos;t have to begin from fresh. We checked that their Ideal Customer Profile was
          accurate, evaluated potential customers and determined their target markets. Since the
          target market was to be expanded beyond the US and Canada, we also included Europe. The
          other steps were purely procedural: building a target lead list based on the client&apos;s
          ICP, identifying contacts inside the target companies, providing the contacts with more
          information, and ultimately investigating the contacts for individualized outreach. The
          labor-intensive procedure of compiling a targeted lead list was completed by the Leadingly
          team. It was necessary to create a sales pipeline and fill it with fresh, hot prospects.
          Leadingly was launching marketing campaigns to promote Shri Genesis not only in the US and
          Canada but also in Europe in order to guarantee an endless stream of appointments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Lead Qualification </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Pre-qualification calls were a regular procedure at Shri Genesis. The Leadingly team first
          neglected to incorporate it into their lead generation plan. Based on their online
          behavior and buying signals, we would calculate the lead temperature and handle it as a
          warm lead that needs nurturing if the lead and SDR interacted frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after a while, we saw a decline in the conversion rate of the fresh appointments we
          had generated. In comparison to the appointments generated through the client&apos;s
          outreach, it was lower. We were fairly certain that their pre-qualification calls were the
          primary cause.
        </p>
        <p>
          After six months we realised how much sense pre-qualification makes. Before the call, we
          started giving all the prospects with all the information. It enabled us to qualify them
          quickly and increase conversion rates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Templates for Cold Emails </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Leadingly team prepared two distinct templates for STM and Social Sciences while
          keeping in mind the target audiences. We then customized each design to produce a fresh
          set of templates for various socio economic groupings {"("}senior researchers, professors,
          etc.{")"}. We tried to avoid seeming very salesy or pitchy. We chose to communicate with
          the prospects in a warm and genuine manner, engaging them in conversations and providing
          them with as much information as we could. Because of this, those appointments who
          weren&apos;t interested straight away kept thinking about us and returned when the
          necessity arose after a few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the essential factors we take into account while developing cold email templates is
          email deliverability. It&apos;s crucial to circumvent spam filters and deliver your
          message directly to the prospect&apos;s inbox as well as to demonstrate from the outset
          your empathy and research abilities in personalisation. As a result, we frequently modify
          our cold email templates to ensure that there are no deliverability problems.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Results </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Leadingly was required under the contract to fulfill 40 appointments. The client was
          delighted and pleasantly surprised by the outcomes our team produced<em>:</em>
        </p>
        <p>9 deals closed in the first month.</p>
        <p>
          Customized email templates that assisted the client expand their professional network
          while also enhancing the pre-sales procedure.
        </p>
        <h3 style={{ marginTop: "4rem", marginBottom: "2rem" }}>
          <strong>Key takeaways </strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Work ethics matter: </strong>Leadingly won the trust of Shri Genesis with
          thoughtful strategy and individualized approach. Each team member was a true expert in
          their field, and they all had excellent communication skills. Despite the challenges, they
          did a great job and found the ideal solutions, which have helped Shri Genesis achieve
          amazing outcomes. All tasks were completed as per schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be flexible and attentive to details: </strong>Getting complacent and assuming
          that the project is running flawlessly just because you have a tonne of appointments and
          strong open and reply rates will be unwise. Great stats don&apos;t always imply that
          everything is going well for the client. Inquire about their deals, the status of your
          calls, etc.When we join the client&apos;s team, their success is also a success for us.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Communication is paramount: </strong>That is precisely how we learned that we
          required pre-qualification calls. However, our ability to quickly adapt and adjust enabled
          us to deal with this problem without delay. We were able to respond to all of the problems
          we ran into at work thanks to our flexibility. If there was an issue at all, it was
          discovered without delay due to our capacity for communication.
